## PartySpy

Version 0.0.4

PartySpy is a tool analyzing replay files from the game [SpyParty](http://spyparty.com) in bulk.  It is designed for users to analyze their own play and get better through analysis.  

This tool is in pretty early beta right now, just some basic features to show off.  Pull requests are welcome.  The code is messy, but that's because I wanted to learn Angular and JavaScript and this was a pretty good excuse to do so.


### Known Issues

1. The first time setup sucks
2. Bugs!  Bugs everywhere! (I'm guessing)
3. No journal parsing

### Places to go from here

1. I want to integrate journal processing (or even better, the rest of the replay payload) so we can pull more detailed statistics.
2. I am still bad at CSS and could really use some help making this look prettier.

### Contributing

Issues can be filed here on this GitHub project.  If you want to build and run this locally, you can check out the repo and run `npm install` and then `npm start` to start this in the dev environment.
